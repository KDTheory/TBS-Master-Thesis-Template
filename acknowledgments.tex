I would like to thank a number of people at Atos in particular. First and foremost, my manager, Olivier Mallet, for his support and encouragements, also for matching me with this project and giving me the opportunity to work at a high level, and even allowing me to present my work in front of a large group of the expert community at Atos. Additionally, I would like to thank Yaroslav Logachev for his domain expertise and insights. A special thanks also to my team, for helping me with this project and sharing their knowledge and help me troubleshoot all of my problem.\\

Lastly, I’d like to thank Kevin Carillo, my supervisor, without his guidance and inspiration I would not have been able to complete this thesis. Kevin, you’ve been one of the most approachable and friendly professors I’ve met, and I hope you continue to share that kindness with your students.
