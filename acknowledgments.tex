This thesis project owes a great deal to Atos, as without their knowledge, data, and resources, this project would not have been possible. \\

I would like to thank several people at Atos in particular. First and foremost, my manager, Olivier Mallet, for his support and encouragements, also for matching me with this project and giving me the opportunity to work at a high level, and even allowing me to present my work in front of a large group of the expert community at Atos. Additionally, I would like to thank Yaroslav Logachev for his domain expertise and insights. I would like to thanks the team in the Netherlands for their help with the data set. A special thanks also to my team, for helping me with this project and sharing their knowledge and help me troubleshoot all of my problems.\\
\\
Lastly, Iâ€™d like to thank Kevin Carillo, my supervisor, without his guidance and inspiration I would not have been able to complete this thesis. Kevin, you have been one of the most approachable and friendly professors I have met, and I hope you continue to share that kindness with your students.
