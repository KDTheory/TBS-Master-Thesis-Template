abstract = {The Harmonized System of tariff nomenclature created by the Brussels-based World Customs Organization is widely applied to standardize traded products with Code, Description, Unit of Quantity, and Duty for Classification, to cope with the rapidly increasing international merchandise trade. As part of the function desired by trading system for Singapore Customs, an autocategorization system is expected to accurately classify products into HS codes based on the text description of the goods declaration so to increase the overall usability of the trading system. Background Nets approach has been adopted as the key technique for the development of classification engine in the system. Experimental results indicate the potential of this approach in text categorization with ill-defined vocabularies and complex semantics.},

@article{Kappler2011,
abstract = {This paper examines the extent to which commodity classification errors may contribute to customs revenue shortfalls. It identifies the root causes of this chronic problem and the traditional approaches that have been applied to address traditional community classification monitoring and enforcement, with little evidence of success. It then discusses other approaches that are worthy of examination, such as artificial intelligence technologies, to monitor Harmonized System (HS) declarations that affect duty underpayments, commodity data quality, systems integrity, and risk assessment.},

@book{Manning2008,
abstract = {Class-tested and coherent, this textbook teaches classical and web information retrieval, including web search and the related areas of text classification and text clustering from basic concepts. It gives an up-to-date treatment of all aspects of the design and implementation of systems for gathering, indexing, and searching documents; methods for evaluating systems; and an introduction to the use of machine learning methods on text collections. All the important ideas are explained using examples and figures, making it perfect for introductory courses in information retrieval for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science. Based on feedback from extensive classroom experience, the book has been carefully structured in order to make teaching more natural and effective. Slides and additional exercises (with solutions for lecturers) are also available through the book's supporting website to help course instructors prepare their lectures.},
